# Python Code Analyzer

## Motivation

The main purpose of the app is to allow Python developers navigate Python code base much easier by showing dependencies
among files included in the directory with better visualization.

## Thoughts on solving the problem

1. Build a prototype without UI interface to show dependencies among files included in the directory(output) given user's
input to one GitHub public repo's URL(input)
2. Build a streamlit app to show results using some network visualization tools

## Used technologies

- Streamlit
